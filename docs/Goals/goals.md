## Business Goals

Given our business value is in the learning of something 
new, it makes sense to describe business value as learning 
objectives. Our goals are to:

1. Discover and understand our business context by deriving
   our project's scope from our stakeholders' stated
   business values or needs.
   
2. Facilitate communication with our stakeholders using
   specification by example.
   
3. Create and run executable specifications using Behat.

4. Understand the HTTP methods used in REST.

5. Implement a RESTful API backend in PHP.

6. Document the API with Swagger/OpenAPI.
