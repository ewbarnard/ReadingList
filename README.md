# ReadingList

This repository accompanies the "Education Station" articles planned
for April-June 2018, "Build an API".

In this series, we look at using *Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)*
and *specification by example* to develop a RESTful API with JSON-formatted
request and response. The back end uses CakePHP 3 and MySQL. We use Behat
as our test runner.

* In Part One we introduce these concepts, design our database, and implement
  a minimal working API.

* In Part Two we introduce Behavior-Driven Development.
